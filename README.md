## Predicting Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning

### Overview
This project aims to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using machine learning models applied to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to assist medical professionals in achieving faster and more reliable diagnoses through a binary classification approach.
